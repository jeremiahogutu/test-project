# test-project

In this project I created a program that increments a value inputted by the user until we get the first possible outcome, where all digits in the new value are unique from the original value entered by the user.

example 

input: 7 = output: 8

input: 10 = output: 22

input: 3261 = output: 4000

input 1234 = output: 5000
